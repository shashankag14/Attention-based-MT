A similar effect can be achieved in PHP 3 by passing an array of arguments to a function:
To use PHP' s CURL support you must also compile PHP --with-curl[=DIR] where DIR is the location of the directory containing the lib and include directories.
If arg_num is greater than the number of arguments actually passed, a warning will be generated and func_get_arg() will return FALSE.
